HELP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Boy, you're really lost, huh.

You can use the HELP command to search for help topics such as "HELP SAY". If a help topic exists 
with that name, you will be shown it, otherwise, a search will be performed on all help topics for 
the word "SAY" and send you back a list of all topics that include that word.

Good luck out there!
