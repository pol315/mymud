GO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the GO command with a direction. You can go NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, UP, and DOWN!

You can also go in these directions by skipping the GO command - such as only typing NORTH.

Furthermore, each direction has a single letter shortcut - N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, SE, U and D!
